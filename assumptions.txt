1) if given aliens number (M) is greater than cities number (N), then only N aliens will be created in the world

2) if alien is trapped in some city (can't go anywhere) each iteration increase the number of it's steps

3) that the city names will never contain numeric characters

4) when map is loading: city pairs are created together (north-south, west-east)
    if there is no line for the city but it is referenced in some direction then this city will be present in the map

5) one thread!
