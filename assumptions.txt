1) initially aliens are spread through cities randomly, when more than one alien goes to the same city, only last one get there, others are gone // if two aliens are placed into the same city during initial accomodation, they kill each other and destroy the city

2) if alien is trapped in some city each iteration increase the number of it's steps

3) that the city names will never contain numeric characters

4) when map is loading: citie pairs are created together (north-south, west-east)
    if there is no line for the city but it is referenced in some direction then this city will be present in the map

5) one thread!
